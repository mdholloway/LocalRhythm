LocalRhythm
===========

This is a location-based music discovery app built on the [Spotify Android SDK](https://developer.spotify.com/technologies/spotify-android-sdk/) and powered by the [Echo Nest](https://developer.echonest.com/) and [Spotify](https://developer.spotify.com/) APIs. The core java files are [here](https://github.com/mdholloway/LocalRhythm/tree/master/app/src/main/java/co/hollowlog/localrhythm). The server code is at [localrhythm-server](https://github.com/mdholloway/localrhythm-server/).

Currently requires [Spotify Premium](https://www.spotify.com/us/premium/) membership.  The next step for this project is to transition away from Spotify in favor of the [Free Music Archive](http://freemusicarchive.org/).
